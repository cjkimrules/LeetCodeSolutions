## Basic Calculator

Problem found here: https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator/

The one I did is upgraded version of this. Not only (), +, -, but also x,/ work.
Also there is "A" to store the previous calculation. "sqrt" for square root.

Negative and decimal points are allowed.

Square root of negative numbers are NOT allowed.

"-.4" is allowed syntax.

"--2" is not allowed. Just type "2".
